# Documentation

This app allows users to use their webcam to scan barcodes of books and/or search them up to add to their virtual library. They can then organize these books between "Want to Read" and "Books Read." If you ever find a book out in public or in the library that you want to keep track of and remember, this is a great application for that!

## Installation

### Running on Any Platform
Windows: Use PowerShell, ensure `pip` and `git` are installed. <br />
macOS: Use Terminal, ensure `brew` or `pip` is updated. <br />
Linux: Use `bash`, ensure `python3` and `pipenv` are installed.


## Usage Guide

### 1. Set Up a Virtual Environment
```
python3 -m venv error404
source error404/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
pip install all of these packages:
```
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install flask
pip3 install flask-login

pip3 install requests
python3 -m pip install coverage
pip3 install pytest
```
or you can just do:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the provided `env.example` file to `.env` in the project root and fill in the information with your own `URI`, `DBNAME`, and `SECRET_KEY` (or check the error404 team channel on Discord to get access to our database). <br />

env.example file:
```
# MongoDB connection string (must begin with mongodb+srv:// or mongodb://)
URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<your-cluster>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=virtualLibrary

# Name for MongoDB Database
